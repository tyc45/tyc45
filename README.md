### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jordan Tyczynski, a french developper eager to learn as much as possible about coding and contributing to various projects.

You can checkout my various repos to learn about my realizations.
You can also get an idea of my coding level on [my codewars page](https://www.codewars.com/users/tyc45)
